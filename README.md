# TitanicClassification
Step 1: Data Collection and Exploration
Dataset:

Obtain the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers including features like age, gender, socio-economic class, and whether they survived or not.
Load and Explore:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and explore it using descriptive statistics and visualizations. Understand the distribution of features and their relationships.
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Missing Values:

Handle missing values in the dataset. Common techniques include imputation (e.g., filling missing values with the mean or median), or dropping rows or columns with too many missing values.
Categorical Variables:

Convert categorical variables (like gender) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features or modify existing ones that may be useful for prediction. For example, you might derive a "family size" feature from the number of siblings/spouses and parents/children.
Step 3: Data Splitting
Train-Test Split:
Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.
Step 4: Model Selection and Training
Choose a Model:

For a binary classification task like this one (survived or not), popular models include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Train the Model:

Train the chosen model on the training data. Use an evaluation metric (like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) to assess its performance.
Step 5: Model Evaluation
Test Set Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using the chosen evaluation metric.
Fine-Tuning:

Experiment with different hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve performance.
Step 6: Interpret Results
Feature Importance:

Analyze which features have the most impact on survival predictions. This can provide insights into the factors that contribute to survival.
Visualizations:

Create visualizations to help interpret the results, such as feature importance plots or confusion matrices.
